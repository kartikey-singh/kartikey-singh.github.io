## Projects

Here I present selected projects that I find quite interesting. 

- **Third Position in HCL Lucknow AI Hackathon**
    - Built a complete product under 24 hours working in a team of four to build a biased free source of news and used 
    automatic topic assignment and ranking for it.
    - Used Twitter APIs, Topic modelling(LDA), Flask, ReactJS.
    - [CODE](https://github.com/kartikey-singh/HCL-Hackathon)

- **Replicating-SeER**
    - Replication of SeER: An Explainable Deep Learning MIDI-based Hybrid Song Recommender System in TensorFlow2.
    - Provided first publicly available copy of their dataset and code.
    - [CODE](https://github.com/kartikey-singh/Replicating-SeER)

- **Vote for Change**
    - Created a polling website where users can poll on their topic of interest after signing up and shows statistics and 
    graphs of the resulting poll to users.
    - Part of the code.fun.do hackathon and used Django, jQuery for it.
    - [LINK](http://voteforchange.herokuapp.com/)

- **Orthographic Languages Similarity Measurements**
    - Extracted similar words between Orthographic languages along with their distance by using provided corpora with 
    the help of Longest Common Substring (LCS), n-gram and DICE algorithms.
    - Part of CSE-443 (Natural Language Processing) coursework, received grade A for it.    
    - [CODE](https://github.com/kartikey-singh/Orthographic-Languages-Similarity-Measurements)

- **Automated Direction Detecting Bot**
    - Created a wireless bot that processes an image and traverses according to the direction detected by it.
    - Used VGG-19 architecture to develop the CNN model and part of final year project for bachelorâ€™s degree.
    - [CODE](https://github.com/kartikey-singh/Automated-Direction-Detecting-Bot)

- **Recommendation System** 
    - Music and Movie recommender systems using collaborative filtering on public datasets.    
    - Used various matrix factorization algorithms and metrics to generate findings.

- **Face and Emotion Detector**
    - Developed a face and emotion detection system capable of classifying various types of emotions by the usage of HAAR cascade classifiers and Fisherface algorithm built in OpenCV.
    - This application also implements various emojis ,quotes ,colours and sound techniques for enhancing the experience.
    - [CODE](https://github.com/kartikey-singh/Face-and-Emotion-Detector)

- **WebTree**
    - An application which creates a PDF by using the structured graph of a webpage and it's related webpages through the use of URL's.
    - It uses the connection between webpages to join them together and create an offline PDF of the webpage with the help of depth first search (DFS).    
    - [CODE](https://github.com/kartikey-singh/WebTree)

## Position of Responsibility

These are the projects that I did as part of IIT (BHU) technical teams.

- **Member of Technex-18 Technical Team**
    - Developed a scalable/modular web application for the tech fest of IIT(BHU) (used by more than 15k participants), solved various tech-related issues throughout the year

- **Web Developer for Institute Day Portal**
    - Created a web application, working in a team for the Institute Day of IIT(BHU) used by 150 students at the institute to present their projects.
