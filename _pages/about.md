## Hi! 

I am Kartikey Singh. 

I will be joining Paytm by the end of July as a Software Engineer. In the past, I have worked as a software intern at Samsung Research Institute Bangalore and Melopond Online Radio.

I am passionate about deep learning, recommendation systems, building backend. I like to undertake challenging projects and learn new technologies.  

Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate from the Department of Electronics Engineering (ECE), Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) in July, 2020. 

Please check out my technical journey (Résumé/Curriculum vitae) on the [CV](/cv/) page.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:kartikey.singh.ind@gmail.com) if you have any collaboration or research ideas or think I might be a good fit or simply would like to connect. 

For a glimpse of my technical experience, hobbies and projects, please checkout my [Portfolio](/portfolio/). I also like to write about things that I find interesting and sometimes I just ramble on [Posts](/posts/).

## Motto:

### "When the going gets tough, the tough get going."

## Hobbies
I [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109040067-kartikey-singh) a lot of fiction on a wide range of topics. I also like hiking, gardening and jogging.
